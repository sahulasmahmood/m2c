    // Use Cloudinary's own transformation pipeline instead of Vercel's
    // image optimizer.
    //
    // Why: Vercel's /_next/image service has a monthly quota of "optimized
    // image transformations" per account. On May 22 2026 we hit the cap and
    // started getting 402 Payment Required responses, breaking category
    // banners, subcategory cards, and product images across the site.
    //
    // Every customer-facing image already lives on Cloudinary. Cloudinary
    // supports URL-based transformations natively (f_auto for format
    // negotiation, q_auto for quality, w_<n> for responsive sizing) and
    // serves them from its own global CDN. Routing optimization through
    // Vercel as a middleman burned quota and added a hop for marginal —
    // sometimes negative — benefit.
    //
    // The custom loader rewrites Cloudinary URLs in place to add the
    // optimization parameters Next.js would have asked Vercel to do, and
    // passes any non-Cloudinary URL through unchanged. Result: same
    // responsive sizing and modern formats we had before, served from
    // Cloudinary directly, with no Vercel image quota usage.
